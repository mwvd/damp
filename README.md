Damp
================

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwvd/damp/gh-pages/assets/1.png "screen")


a publishing experiment for a post-paper society


print is falling off but it's still half exciting. this will be something leaner and more deliberate. I'm calling it '**damp**'

I'm looking for artists, writers, and devs to contribute

I want to integrate every experience - one page of composition & movement & ideas & maybe even secrets


```

damp magazine {
    issue #1: oil money;
    coming: july 11th;
    }

```
